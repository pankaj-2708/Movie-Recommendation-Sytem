# Movie_Recomm_System
# 🎥 Movie Recommendation System using Content-Based Filtering

A powerful and interactive **content-based movie recommender system** that suggests movies based on three distinct perspectives: **story**, **cast & crew**, and **scale**. Built with Python and Streamlit using the **TMDb 5000 Movie Dataset**, the system also includes an interactive data analysis dashboard.

---

## 🚀 Features

* 🔍 **Three distinct recommendation strategies**:

  1. **Story-based**: Uses the movie's `title`, `overview`, and `tagline` to recommend movies with similar themes and narratives.
  2. **Cast & Crew-based**: Leverages information about `cast`, `crew`, `production companies`, and `production countries` to suggest movies with similar creators or production styles.
  3. **Scale-based**: Considers numerical attributes like `budget`, `revenue`, `profit`, and `popularity` to suggest movies of similar commercial scale or success.

* 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** section to interactively explore the TMDb dataset (5,000 movies).

* 🧠 Uses **cosine similarity** from scikit-learn to calculate similarity between movies.

* 🎨 Clean and responsive **Streamlit** UI.

* 🎞️ Shows posters and movie titles in an easy-to-browse layout.

* 🧰 Sidebar customization and filtering options.

* API is dockerized and hosted on aws and code is attached here. API docker image -> docker pull pankajmaulekhi/movie-recomm-api:latest
